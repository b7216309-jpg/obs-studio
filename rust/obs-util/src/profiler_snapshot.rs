//! Safe core of `libobs/util/profiler-snapshot.c`: walking and filtering
//! the entries of a profiler snapshot.
//!
//! Snapshots are built by `profiler.c`, which stays C. The C ABI shim in
//! [`crate::ffi::profiler_snapshot`] reads them in place; this module holds
//! the loop logic, written against [`EntryList`] so it runs the same over
//! the C darray and over a `Vec` in tests.
